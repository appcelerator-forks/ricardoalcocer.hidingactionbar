# Hiding the ActionBar

This repo contains 4 examples of hiding the ActionBar in Titanium 3.3.0+.

1. Using the hide() method
2. Using a custom theme
3. Using multiple themes and specify theme in each Window definition (new in 3.3.1)
4. Using a TabGroup with no ActionBar

**NOTE**

Everytime you choose not to use the ActionBar, you're moving away from Android's native navigation and menu system, which means that you'll have to manually code and implement any means of navigation and providing menus to your user.
